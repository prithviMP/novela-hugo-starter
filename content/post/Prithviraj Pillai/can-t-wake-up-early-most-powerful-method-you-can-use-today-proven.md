If you are here then you already know how important it is to get up early. But for some reason, you just can’t no matter how hard you try.

I am a night person you say. I don't want to get up early or I cant no matter how hard u say. Well, worry not, something interesting to your rescue.

Ever wondered how come that day you got up so early even before the alarm went off. yeah that day dude, don't you remember? come on you do know when was that. Ehh! Let me help you remember

1. The road trip with your friends where you started early to beat the annoying city traffic.
2. Had to pick up your favorite cousin from the airport.
3. The bike ride to see the sunrise.
4. Again went to pick up your GF/BF early morning because it's been so long you didn't see each other. Aww!
5. Exams!.

So do you see the pattern?………….If you are here then you already know how important it is to get up early. But for some reason, you just can’t no matter how hard you try.

It's Love, Fear(Exams), Anxiety, Drive etc. Basically its **emotions**. We human being are emotional creatures. Unless we attach emotions to something its hard for us to perceive it.

You need to ask yourself, what is that you are doing every day. Do you really love what you are doing, are you happy, were you the one who decided to do this thing. Your work, career, job, business etc. If not its time to ask the big question **WHY?**

Don’t let the noise of other’s opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.”_

4. Love the most beautiful one of all. do it for your loved ones at least.
5. Finally, do it for yourself. I know you can do it.

And there you will wake up early as if it was not a big deal at all.
