I am a quick learner!

Not because I have a great “grasping power.”

Not because I have an “IQ” far greater than you.

Trust me I was an “Average Learner” like everyone else before.

Wondering what makes me a super learner??

Here is the answer to that question.

> **_EACH ONE TEACH ONE_**

This is not some random quote. It is the most inspiring quote originated and used by African-American as a war cry for their struggle to get proper education and equality.

This just doesn’t apply to that movement. It was used and still being used by many others for a special cause.

Wondering why all this story ?

During my school days too I used to always teach someone. like helping my Mother in taking tuition to teach First Grade math's when I was in Sixth grade and help my friends to understand some complex problem or some science stuff they wont understand.

The above circus continued throughout my education.

And now when i picked up web development as my career. It was a new field to me.

**So I started applying these below tricks while learning something new**

1. _Study like you will teach it to someone_
2. _Find someone who is studying the same so that you can teach them._
3. _Prepare proper notes and explain it on a white board if possible._
4. _Ask them what have they learnt form you and revise with him_
5. _Ask them questions on that topic which makes you think beyond the basics._

This is how I was able to master the skills in a very less time and understood all concepts to the core.

And trust me there is nothing like helping someone to get going in their life and pulling up someone when you make it to the top.

My take is why not pull someone up while reaching the top. Doing so you would reach fast and in a better position and the gratification you get one someone credits you for their achievement is more than anything in this world.

Come on start teaching someone today!.
